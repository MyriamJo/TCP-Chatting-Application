# TCP-Chatting-Application

## Programming Language
Python

## Description
This project implements a TCP-based chatting application in Python that supports multiple clients connecting to a single server. The server uses threading to handle concurrent client interactions, maintains client details using a data structure, and responds to messages in uppercase. Connections stay open until a client sends "CLOSE SOCKET"
